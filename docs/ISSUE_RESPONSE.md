# 📋 Drift Analysis and Remediation Plan

## 🔍 Drift Analysis Summary

Based on the drift detection report from 2025-10-14T09:37:41-04:00, I've analyzed the detected infrastructure drift and prepared comprehensive remediation guidance.

### Key Findings:

1. **Resource Group (`azurerm_resource_group.terragrunt-test-drift`)**
   - **Impact**: Low
   - **Change Type**: Tag modifications
   - **Risk**: Operational/governance impact, no security risk

2. **Storage Account (`azurerm_storage_account.terragrunt-test-drift_storage`)**
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Change Type**: Security configuration downgrade + tag modifications
   - **Risk**: TLS 1.0 is deprecated and vulnerable to known attacks

---

## 🚨 Security Assessment

### Critical Security Issue Identified:
- **Storage Account TLS Version**: Downgraded from `TLS1_2` to `TLS1_0`
- **Severity**: Medium-High
- **Vulnerability**: TLS 1.0 is vulnerable to:
  - BEAST attack
  - POODLE attack (when fallback occurs)
  - Does not meet PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or SOC 2 compliance requirements

**Recommendation**: Immediate remediation required to restore TLS 1.2

## 🛠️ Remediation Options

I've created comprehensive remediation resources for this drift:

### 📚 Documentation Created:
1. **[Complete Remediation Guide](./DRIFT_REMEDIATION.md)** - Detailed analysis, root cause, and remediation strategies
2. **[Quick Fix Reference](./docs/drift-quick-fix.md)** - Fast commands for immediate action
3. **[Automated Fix Script](./scripts/fix-drift.sh)** - One-command remediation

### ⚡ Quick Remediation (Recommended)

#### Option 1: Automated Fix (Fastest)
```bash
# Run the automated remediation script
./scripts/fix-drift.sh
```

#### Option 2: Using Makefile
```bash
# Fix drift using make
make fix-drift

# Or simply redeploy
make deploy
```

#### Option 3: Manual Terragrunt
```bash
cd terragrunt

# Review changes
terragrunt run-all plan

# Apply to fix drift
terragrunt run-all apply

# Clean up extra resources
STORAGE_NAME=$(cd azure/dev/eastus/storage && terragrunt output -raw name)
az storage container delete \
  --name drift-test-container \
  --account-name $STORAGE_NAME \
  --auth-mode login
```

---

## 📊 Expected Remediation Results

After running remediation, the following will be restored:

### Resource Group:
- ✅ `Environment` tag: `production` → `dev`
- ✅ `ManagedBy` tag: `manual` → `terragrunt`
- ✅ Drift-specific tags removed

### Storage Account:
- ✅ TLS version: `TLS1_0` → `TLS1_2` (Security restored)
- ✅ Tags reverted to Terraform state
- ✅ Extra blob container `drift-test-container` removed

---

## 🔐 Root Cause Analysis

### How This Drift Occurred

This drift was **intentionally created** for testing purposes using the `scripts/create-drift.ps1` script. The script:

1. Modified resource group tags to simulate tag drift
2. Changed storage account TLS version to demonstrate security drift
3. Created an extra blob container to show resource drift

### Prevention for Production Environments

To prevent similar drift in production:

1. **Resource Locks**:
   ```bash
   az lock create --name PreventDrift \
     --lock-type CanNotDelete \
     --resource-group <rg-name>
   ```

2. **Azure Policy**: Enforce minimum TLS version
   - Deny storage accounts with TLS < 1.2
   - Automatically remediate tag drift

3. **RBAC Controls**: Limit who can modify resources

4. **Automated Drift Detection**: 
   - Schedule regular `terragrunt plan` runs
   - Alert on detected drift
   - GitHub Actions workflow for continuous monitoring

---

## ✅ Validation Steps

After remediation, verify the fix:

### 1. Check for Remaining Drift
```bash
cd terragrunt
terragrunt run-all plan
# Expected output: "No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration."
```

### 2. Verify Resource Configuration
```bash
# Resource Group Tags
RG_NAME=$(cd azure/dev/eastus/resource-group && terragrunt output -raw name)
az group show --name $RG_NAME --query tags

# Storage Account Security
STORAGE_NAME=$(cd azure/dev/eastus/storage && terragrunt output -raw name)
az storage account show \
  --name $STORAGE_NAME \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --query "{tls:minimumTlsVersion,tags:tags}"
```

### 3. Confirm Container Cleanup
```bash
az storage container list \
  --account-name $STORAGE_NAME \
  --auth-mode login \
  --query "[].name"
# Should only show containers defined in Terraform
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Immediate**: Run remediation using one of the options above
2. ✅ **Verify**: Confirm drift is resolved with `terragrunt plan`
3. ✅ **Document**: Update any runbooks or procedures as needed
4. ✅ **Monitor**: Set up drift detection automation for early detection

## 🔄 Re-testing Drift Detection

After fixing the drift, if you want to test drift detection again:

```bash
# Create drift
make add-drift

# Detect drift
make plan

# Fix drift
make fix-drift
```

**Note**: This is a test repository designed to demonstrate drift detection capabilities. The drift was intentionally created and is safe to remediate.

For production environments, always:
- Review changes carefully before applying
- Test in non-production first
- Have a rollback plan
- Document all changes
